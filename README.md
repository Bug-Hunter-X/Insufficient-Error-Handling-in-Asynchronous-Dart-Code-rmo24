# Insufficient Error Handling in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: insufficient error handling when working with asynchronous operations like network requests. The `bug.dart` file shows the flawed code, while `bugSolution.dart` presents a more robust solution.

## Bug Description

The original code fetches data from a remote API. It handles the case where the API request fails with a non-200 status code. However, its error handling is inadequate.  It only prints a generic error message to the console, lacking details crucial for debugging and user experience. Furthermore, no specific handling is provided for potential exceptions during JSON decoding or other parts of the process.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a more comprehensive solution. It introduces:

* **More specific error messages:**  Provides informative error messages based on specific error types.
* **Custom exceptions:** Creates custom exceptions to differentiate between various error conditions.
* **Error handling within the `catch` block:** Performs more meaningful operations within the `catch` block, such as logging errors in detail, presenting user-friendly messages, or retrying failed requests under specific conditions.
* **Error propagation and handling:** Properly propagates and handles exceptions to higher levels where appropriate actions (e.g., displaying error UI) can be taken.

This improved error handling improves the application's reliability and makes debugging and user feedback significantly easier.
